# Preparing Terraform variables
Before using this code we need to create terraform.tfvars file which look like terraform-draft.tfvars file in the same location. It is described there what values to provide. We are assigning there values to variables from the variables.tf file located in the same folder. In the variables.tf we can also find descriptions of those variables. We need to assign values only for those variables which doesn't have assigned the default value.
